## Introduction

This repository contains the tasks and projects I completed during my internship at MSInterface. Each task is documented with descriptions, code snippets, and any other relevant information to help understand the work done and the results achieved.

## Tasks

### Task 1: Implement Caesar Cipher

**Description:**
- The Caesar cipher is a simple encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of places down or up the alphabet.

**Objective:**
- To create a tool that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar cipher technique.

**Implementation:**

The Caesar cipher implementation involves the following steps:

1. **Importing Prerequisites:**
   - In this case, we do not have any external libraries to import other than Python's built-in `string` module, but it is not necessary for this specific implementation.

2. **Defining the Function:**
   - We define a function `caesar_cipher` that takes three parameters: `text` (the input string), `shift` (the number of positions to shift the letters), and `mode` (either 'encrypt' or 'decrypt').

3. **Encrypting/Decrypting the Text:**
   - The function iterates over each character in the input `text`.
   - For uppercase letters, it shifts the ASCII value within the range of uppercase letters.
   - For lowercase letters, it shifts the ASCII value within the range of lowercase letters.
   - Non-letter characters are added to the result as-is.


4. **Adding ASCII Art:**
   - To give a professional touch to the tool, we add ASCII art displaying "CC-TOOL-KIT" and the author's name.

5. **User Interaction:**
   - The user is prompted to choose whether they want to encrypt or decrypt the text.
   - The user is then asked to enter the text and the shift value.
   - Based on the user's choice, the text is either encrypted or decrypted, and the result is displayed.

**Results:**
- Any results, screenshots, or output generated from this task.

### Task 2: Task Name
